Made in Abyss is an adventure story about two kids descending down a deep and mysterious pit in search for the protagonist's mom, who got lost somewhere at the bottom of the pit. On their way down the two kids traverse several fantastic layers with all kinds of dangers and mysteries to uncover. The layer shown here is the 'Inverted Forest', an area where updrafts are so strong that forests grow upside-down and even water flows upwards. This allows the trees to be used as platforms to jump across the landscape.",
